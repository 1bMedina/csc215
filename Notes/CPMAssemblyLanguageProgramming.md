# CP/M Assembly Language Programming Notes
### Blu Medina

## Preface
- Assembly language can be found everywhere
    - Assembly is compact and has a high speed of execution
    - Assembly forces the user to think in machine compared to other languages that look like simple English
    - To use assembly one needs to study the internal structure of the machine, learn the instruction set, and live with its size and mathematical capabilities
- Control Program/Microcomputer (CP/M) has simplified the learning process for assembly
    - The assembly languages became portable, aka hardware independent  
    - No matter the make or model of the computer being used, the programmer will be working in a familiar environment
    - CP/M makes all computers look alike
    - Experimenting with a CP/M based computer is okay as it can't be damaged from the operator's console

## Introduction
- Your keystrokes are displayed in bold
    - Other characters are displayed by CP/M
    - `cr` represents you hitting return
- Mnemonics make it easier to read assembly source code
- A source program is keyed into a disk file using CP/M's ED.COM, then assembled by CP/M's ASM.COM
    - The editor and assembler provide the most error-free method of program generation
- Assembly is the best for intimate interfacing with the hardware
- Assembly is useful for:
    - Writing programs where program size must be minimized
    - Where speed of execution is most important
- Required Materials:
    - This book
    - CP/M based computer
        - Manual that accompanies the CP/M operating system
    - One complete copy of the CP/M system disk
        - Fresh clean empty disk should be dedicated to your exercises
    - Copy of "8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual," publication number 98-940
