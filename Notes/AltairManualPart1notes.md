# Altair Manual Notes - Part One

## Part 1 Introduction
- The Altair 8800 is the most economical computer
- The heart of an Altair 8800 is Intel Corporation's Model 8080 Microcomputer 
    - A complete CPU on a single silicon chip
- The Altair has 78 machine language instructions
- The Altair is capable of preforming several operations that aren't usually available with conventional mini-computers

## A. Logic
- George Boole is a 19th century British mathematician
- Boole showed how any logical statement can be analyzed with simple arithmetic relationships
    - He did not equate mathematics with logic
- All practical digital computers and other electronic circuits are based upon the logic concepts explained by Boole
    - His 1847 booklet *The Mathematical Analysis of Logic*
- Boole's system of logic (Boolean algebra) assumes that a logic condition or statement is either true or false
    - Cannot be both and cannot be partially true or partially false
- An electronic analogy of a logical statement can be readily synthesized
- It is possible to devise electronic equivalents for AND, OR, and NOT
    - AND: true only if **all** of its logic conditions are true
    - OR: true if **any** of its logic conditions are true
    - NOT: reverses the meaning of a logic statement (i.e.: true to false and false to true)
- A switch ON is true and OFF is false
    - A switch OFF will not pass an electrical current, therefore it can be assigned a numerical value of 0
    - A switch ON will pass an electrical current, therefore it can be assigned a numerical value of 1
- Various permutations for a two condition AND statement:
